                </h2>
                <p className="text-base text-gray-400">
                  Mental health is more than just the absence of mental
                  illness. It is a state of well-being in which people are able
                  to think, feel, and act in ways that are positive and
                  productive. Mental health is important for everyone,
                  regardless of age, race, gender, or socioeconomic status.

                  How it Affects Us
                </h2>
                <p className="text-base text-gray-400">
                  Mental health affects us in many ways. It can affect our
                  thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It can also affect our
                  relationships, our work, and our overall quality of life.
                  Mental health plays a crucial role in our day-to-day
                  activities. When our mental health is compromised, it can
                  impact various aspects of our lives, and a lack of interest in
                  activities we once enjoyed.
